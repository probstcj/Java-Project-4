# Project 4
## Radar Game

This is the final project for the Java II class. We were supposed to build a game that had simple radar mechanics and used the Java GUI components.

## Objective

Project 4 is a complex program that took a ton of development time. The objective of this is to simply have a good looking game and have it functional.

## Running the Program

To run this program, download the `executable` folder and run the following command:
`java -jar RadarProject.jar`

## Using the Program

To use the program, you simply follow the GUI and use it. Use the mouse button to shoot. The red are the enemies and the green are powerups which will show up on screen. When an enemy or powerup is under the sweeper, it will show up on the radar.
